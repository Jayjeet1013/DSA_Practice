Data types in C++ are mainly divided into three types: 
1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 
Integer
Character
Boolean
Floating Point
Double Floating Point
Valueless or Void
Wide Character
2. Derived Data Types: The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
Function
Array
Pointer
Reference
3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 
Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined Datatype
